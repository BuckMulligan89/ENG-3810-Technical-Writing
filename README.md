# ENG-3810-Technical-Writing
Ryan M. Omizo, Ph.D; Mazur Hall 204 Meeting Time: TR 12:30pm â€“ 1:50pm

I would define technical writing as professionally conveying specific or specialized information about a certain topic. This writing not only explains, but also serves as a guide for practical implementation. The Github guide definitely facilitated learning about using this software. Without any prior experience, I am still a bit overwhelmed and confused by the new terminology and symbols. The illustrations that accompanied the text were useful as visual aids and reassured me when I was uncertain about the next step. Perhaps a step-by-step video guide would be even more helpful in demonstrating the use of this software.
