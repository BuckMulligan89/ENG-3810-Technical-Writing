To create a new folder in a repository 

Through the web interface, click “create a new file.” Type your new folder’s name in the area where you would write the file name, and at the end of the file name type a “/” to initilize it as a folder.

When creating a new folder, use slashes to specify the directory.
Type the name of the file after the slash to create the file within that new directory.
For example:

Name the file:

repositoryname/newfoldername/filename

GitHub will automatically create a folder with the name newfoldername.
